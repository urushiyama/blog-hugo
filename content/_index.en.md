# Yuta URUSHIYAMA

Hello! My name is Yuta Urushiyama.
I proceed with HCI research and app development, aiming to be an application engineer who can logically explain why the product has usability.
I like argument labels, thus I mainly use the Swift language both for research and for personal app development.
SerialBuddy, which is the serial communication app for macOS that I released, achieved 1st rank of Dev Tools on Mac App Store (Jan. 11, 2020).
