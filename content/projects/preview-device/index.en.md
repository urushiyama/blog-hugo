YUPreviewDevice.framework adds pre-defined preview devices for SwiftUI.

<!--more-->

[SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) is the one of elegant ways for building native UI.
However, its preview is totally messy.
To show preview on a specific device, you need to exactly type a specific name such as "iPhone XÊ€", "iPad Pro (12.9-inch) (2nd generation)" or "Apple Watch Series 4 - 40mm" in `View.previewDevice(_:)`.
How can we remember the exact name?

YUPreviewDevice.framework adds pre-defined preview devices for SwiftUI.
Using this framework, you can easily preview your app on a specific device:
```swift
struct YourSwiftUIView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
  static var previews: some View {
    YourSwiftUIView()
      .previewDevice(PreviewDevice.iPhone_11_Pro_Max)
      .previewDisplayName(PreviewDevice.iPhone_11_Pro_Max.rawValue)
  }
}
```

You can also easily preview your app on multiple iOS devices with different ratio:
```swift
struct YourSwiftUIView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
  static var previews: some View {
    ForEach(PreviewDevice.Product.latest_iOS_devices_with_defferent_ratio) { device in
      YourSwiftUIView()
        .previewDevice(PreviewDevice(rawValue: device.name))
        .previewDisplayName(device.name)
    }
  }
}
```
