How do you debug serial communication while developing with micro-controllers?
There are some ways such as typing `cu` or `screen` or opening development tools for microcontrollers.
However, have you seen a tool with a console, a plotter, and an communication analyzer?

That's why I made this app.

This app comes with:

- "Ordinal" serial console
- Line and spectrum plotter
- Serial communication analyzer (currently on data transmission)
