I've thought having a website might be useful to write profile data, portfolio, and blog pages since I became a member of the lab. Github pages is a preferred host which is free & have the same domain as projects' page will have. I checked some static site generator and decided to use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) because its sales talk says it is "The world's fastest framework".
